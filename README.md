# Digital Medicine Reminder Using Arduino

This repository contains the Arduino code, configuration, and assembly instructions for building a digital medicine reminder using an Arduino Uno. The system reminds users to take their medication at specified times by activating a buzzer, LED, and displaying messages on an LCD <button class="citation-flag" data-index="1">. This project is ideal for ensuring timely medication intake, especially for elderly individuals or those with busy schedules.

## Overview
The digital medicine reminder uses an RTC module to track time and trigger reminders at specific intervals. When it's time to take medication, the system activates a buzzer and LED while displaying a reminder message on the LCD <button class="citation-flag" data-index="7">. Users can acknowledge the alarm by pressing a button, which turns off the buzzer and resets the system <button class="citation-flag" data-index="3">. This project ensures users never miss their medication doses.

## Arduino Code Explanation
The provided Arduino code uses the RTC module to track time and trigger reminders at predefined intervals <button class="citation-flag" data-index="7">. When the alarm is triggered, the system activates the buzzer, lights up the red LED, and displays a reminder message on the LCD. Pressing the button acknowledges the alarm, turning off the buzzer and resetting the system <button class="citation-flag" data-index="3">.
